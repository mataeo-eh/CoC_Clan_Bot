# CoC_Clan_Bot

A Discord bot that keeps Clash of Clans data at your fingertips: look up wars, assign targets, steer alerts, and explore player profiles without leaving your server. I rely on ChatGPT for research, prototyping ideas, and producing reference material while iterating on the code.

## Highlights

- **Single source of truth** ‚Äì configure clans once with `/set_clan`, link their alerts, and let the war loop broadcast timed reminders automatically.
- **Custom dashboards & schedules** ‚Äì mix-and-match dashboard modules, export CSV snapshots, and automate recurring reports without manual follow-ups.
- **Guided workflows** ‚Äì every interactive command explains what to do after you press enter and provides buttons or dropdowns to finish the job.
- **Player intelligence** ‚Äì link Discord members to their Clash accounts and surface player stats instantly with `/player_info`.
- **Safety first** ‚Äì duplicate-tag protection, permission checks, and clear logging make it easy to understand what the bot is doing.

## Project Overview (tracked files)

- `bot_core.py` ‚Äì Centralises shared Discord state (`bot`, `client`, intents) so multiple modules can register commands without spinning up duplicate clients.
- `main.py` ‚Äì Entry point that logs into Discord/CoC, synchronises slash commands, and imports the command catalogue.
- `Discord_Commands.py` ‚Äì Production command suite (help, clan configuration, alert routing, player linking, war viewers, base assignments, role helpers, and alert toggles) plus the background war-alert loop.
- `COC_API.py` ‚Äì Thin wrapper around `coc.Client` for login, guild configuration, player snapshots, and war helpers.
- `logger.py` ‚Äì Shared logging utility writing DEBUG-level files to `logs/` while only surfacing errors on the console.
- `ENV/Clan_Configs.py` ‚Äì JSON-backed storage helpers for `clans`, `player_tags`, and `player_accounts`, keeping backward compatibility with earlier layouts.
- `ENV/notify_codex_complete.applescript` ‚Äì macOS helper the automation uses to notify me when a TODO run finishes.
- `Discord_command_groups.py` ‚Äì Experimental harness for alternative command grouping patterns.
- `README.md` ‚Äì This detailed guide.

Everything under `ENV/` besides the files listed above (e.g., keys, documentation notes, generated configs) stays private and is ignored in the public repository.

## Command Reference

Each command behaves the same way: fill in any required options, press **Enter** to send the slash command, and then follow the menus or buttons that appear.

### `/help`
- **What it does:** Sends a short reminder of what the bot can do and links back to this README.
- **How to use:** Run the command anywhere; it always answers ephemerally so you can revisit the documentation link without spamming the channel.

### `/set_clan`
- **Purpose:** Register or update a clan name and tag for the server and choose whether war alerts should be enabled.
- **After sending:** If a conflicting tag already exists, the bot prompts you with a replace/keep choice. Success messages recap the tag, whether alerts are enabled, and suggest linking an alert channel.
- **Permissions:** Administrators only.

### `/choose_war_alert_channel`
- **Purpose:** Decide which text channel should receive time-based war alerts for a specific clan.
- **After sending:** Step 1 ‚Äì choose a category; Step 2 ‚Äì pick the channel (use the üîç filter if there are tons of channels); Step 3 ‚Äì confirm. The stored channel is used until you change it again.
- **Permissions:** Administrators only.

### `/configure_dashboard` & `/dashboard`
- **Purpose:** Build configurable dashboards that combine war, donation, upgrade, and opt-in data, and post them on demand or export CSV snapshots.
- **After sending:** `/configure_dashboard` opens an interactive view where admins choose modules, set the output format, and store a default channel. `/dashboard` lets anyone with access post the saved dashboard (or override the modules/format/channel for one-offs).
- **Tips:** Modules accept comma-separated overrides (`war_overview,donation_snapshot`) and the dashboard format can be `embed`, `csv`, or `both`.

### `/link_player`
- **Purpose:** Link or unlink Clash of Clans player tags to Discord members so `/player_info` autocomplete stays fast.
- **Options:** `action` (`link` or `unlink`), `player_tag`, optional `alias`, optional `target_member`.
- **Rules:** Non-admins can only manage their own links; admins can manage anyone. Tags are validated against the Clash API, aliases fall back to the in-game name, and multiple tags per Discord user are supported.
- **After sending:** You get a confirmation showing who the tag belongs to; use `/player_info` right away to see the linked data.

### `/clan_war_info_menu`
- **Purpose:** Pull the current (or most recent) war data for a configured clan and explore it interactively.
- **After sending:** A dropdown appears‚Äîselect the data points you want (attacks, countdowns, rosters, etc.). Use the **Broadcast** button to share the current selection or the **Private Copy** button to keep it for yourself.

### `/player_info`
- **Purpose:** View detailed player stats (heroes, troops, donations, achievements, and more).
- **Options:** `player_reference` accepts a full tag (e.g., `#ABC123`), a saved alias, or a linked Discord member name.
- **After sending:** The same menu-and-buttons pattern as the war view lets you choose the sections you care about and decide whether to share or keep them private.

### `/assign_bases`
- **Purpose:** Share per-player base assignments or broadcast a general battle plan during an active war.
- **After sending:** You‚Äôre given two buttons:
  1. **Per Player Assignments** ‚Äì pick a home base from the dropdown, enter one or two enemy base numbers when prompted, repeat as needed, then hit **Post Assignments** to broadcast the summary (the bot adds the alert-role mention automatically).
  2. **General Assignment Rule** ‚Äì type any free-form instruction (for example, ‚ÄúEveryone attack your mirror‚Äù) and the bot posts it with the usual alert-role mention.
- **Permissions:** Administrators only.

### `/assign_clan_role`
- **Purpose:** Let members assign the appropriate clan role to themselves.
- **After sending:** Pick a clan from the dropdown, then choose whether the confirmation should be broadcast or private.

### `/toggle_war_alerts`
- **Purpose:** Opt in or out of the alert role so members control whether they get pinged when alerts fire.
- **Usage:** Choose **True** to receive alerts or **False** to opt out; the command explains whether the role was added or removed.

### `/configure_war_nudge` & `/war_nudge`
- **Purpose:** Let admins define reusable ‚Äúreasons‚Äù (unused attacks, no attacks, low stars) and ping the appropriate members or roles on demand.
- **After sending:** Configure reasons with mentions and an optional description via `/configure_war_nudge`, then run `/war_nudge` with that reason to post the reminder‚Äîno automated nudges, only when you call it.

### War plan commands (`/save_war_plan`, `/list_war_plans`, `/war_plan`)
- **Purpose:** Store reusable war plans per clan, review what‚Äôs available, and broadcast the chosen plan with a single command.
- **After sending:** Saving stores the plan in the config; listing shows what‚Äôs available; `/war_plan` posts the template to the selected channel.

### `/plan_upgrade` & `/set_upgrade_channel`
- **Purpose:** Members log upcoming upgrades for their linked accounts while admins decide where those notices are posted.
- **After sending:** Upgrades appear in the configured channel with the submitter, account alias, upgrade details, and notes.
- **Bonus:** Each submission is stored (with optional clan association) so dashboards can highlight recent upgrade plans.

### Donation tracking (`/configure_donation_metrics`, `/set_donation_channel`, `/donation_summary`)
- **Purpose:** Highlight top donors (and optionally low donors or negative balances) with per-clan configuration and a dedicated summary channel.
- **After sending:** Metrics updates apply immediately; the summary command fetches live numbers from the Clash API and posts them to the chosen channel.

### Event roles (`/configure_event_role`, `/event_alert_opt`)
- **Purpose:** Maintain opt-in alert roles for events like Clan Games or Raid Weekend.
- **After sending:** Admins map or create the roles, and members (or admins on their behalf) toggle them on demand.

### `/register_me`
- **Purpose:** Give newcomers a single command to opt into alert roles, review linked accounts, and find the documentation.
- **After sending:** Buttons toggle the configured roles, and the response explains how to link tags or explore other utilities.

### Seasonal summaries (`/set_season_summary_channel`, `/season_summary`)
- **Purpose:** Drop end-of-season wrap-ups‚Äîwar records, donation highlights, trophy leaders‚Äîinto a dedicated channel.
- **After sending:** The summary command pulls the latest clan data and posts it wherever you direct (or the default summary channel if set).

### Scheduled reports (`/schedule_report`, `/list_schedules`, `/cancel_schedule`)
- **Purpose:** Automate dashboards, donation summaries, and season wrap-ups so they appear on a daily or weekly cadence.
- **After sending:** `/schedule_report` validates the cadence, stores the schedule, and tells you the next run time. `/list_schedules` shows what‚Äôs queued (with upcoming timestamps), and `/cancel_schedule` removes obsolete entries.
- **Permissions:** Administrators only; the background scheduler respects per-clan channel settings and skips destinations the bot cannot write to.

### `/help_usage`
- **Purpose:** Give administrators anonymised insight into how the bot is used‚Äîtop commands, total traffic, and high-level user activity.
- **After sending:** The command replies ephemerally with aggregate counts (no user identifiers) so you can gauge adoption and spot unused workflows.

### Command Workflow Reminder
Whichever command you choose, remember the pattern:
1. Fill in the slash command‚Äôs options.
2. Press **Enter** to run it.
3. Use the dropdowns, buttons, or modals that appear to finish the workflow.

## War Alert Automation

The background loop (defined in `Discord_Commands.py`) checks every tracked clan every five minutes. It sends alerts when:

- A war is about to start (1 hour, 5 minutes) or has just begun (5 minutes after the start).
- A war is winding down (12 hours, 1 hour, 5 minutes) or just concluded (final score roundup).

Alerts respect the per-clan channel set via `/choose_war_alert_channel`; if the bot loses send permissions for that channel, it skips the alerts until you pick a new destination.

## Scheduled Reports

Another background loop wakes up every minute, looks at the schedules created with `/schedule_report`, and runs anything that is due. Each run recalculates the next trigger using UTC, honours the per-report channel (falling back to configured defaults), and gracefully skips locations where the bot lacks send permissions. Use `/list_schedules` to monitor what‚Äôs queued and `/cancel_schedule` whenever you no longer need an automated recap.

## Logging and Support Files

- The logger writes detailed DEBUG files under `logs/` while only surfacing errors on stdout to keep noisy output away from the console.
- `git_commands.md` (ignored in the public repo) is used in my private workflow to capture commit/push snippets once a TODO run finishes.
- When automation completes a TODO pass, it runs `ENV/notify_codex_complete.applescript` so I get a macOS notification.

If you have questions, open the README (via `/help`) or inspect the source‚Äîdocstrings and inline comments explain the nuts and bolts of each flow. The goal is that an interested teenager‚Äîor anyone curious, regardless of technical background‚Äîcan follow these instructions and get the most out of the bot. Happy raiding!
